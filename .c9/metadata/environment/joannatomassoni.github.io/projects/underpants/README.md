[Math Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math).\n- Within a function, you can use the `arguments` variable to access all the\n  parameters that were passed in even if they aren't named in the function\n  definition. This is useful if you don't know how many arguments are going to\n  be passed in in advance.\n    - You can count the arguments by using `arguments.length` and access each\n      argument using `arguments[i]`.\n    - The `arguments` object is very similar to an array, but note that it does\n      not support most array functions (such as `slice` or `push`). You can read\n      more about this [here](http://www.sitepoint.com/arguments-a-javascript-oddity/).\n\n### Extra Credit:\nSee Instructor for instructions.\n- defaults\n- *once*\n- memoize\n- delay\n- shuffle\n\n### Double Extra Credit:\nSee Instructor for instructions.\n- once\n- invoke\n- sortBy\n- zip\n- flatten\n- intersection\n- difference\n- throttle\n\n**Note:** Some browsers provide built-in functions--including `forEach`, `map`,\n`reduce` and `filter`--that replicate the functionality of some of the functions\nyou will implement. Don't use them to implement your functions.\n","undoManager":{"mark":-2,"position":1,"stack":[[{"start":{"row":4,"column":183},"end":{"row":5,"column":0},"action":"insert","lines":["",""],"id":2}],[{"start":{"row":4,"column":91},"end":{"row":5,"column":0},"action":"insert","lines":["",""],"id":3}]]},"ace":{"folds":[],"scrolltop":287,"scrollleft":0,"selection":{"start":{"row":5,"column":0},"end":{"row":5,"column":0},"isBackwards":false},"options":{"guessTabSize":true,"useWrapMode":false,"wrapToView":true},"firstLineState":0},"timestamp":1567538554025}
